# How it works?
- Within the "pay" method, you simply input the amount of money you possess, and Raseedy will promptly calculate and provide you with the resulting balance.
- In the "balance" method, you only need to input the desired phone recharge amount, and Raseedy will provide you with the corresponding payment total.
